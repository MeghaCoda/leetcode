# leetcode

## A repo filled with my solutions for leetcode problems.

Each file begins with a comment that includes the url, name, description and difficulty of the problem.

A second comment contains the solution runtime, time and space complexity, relative efficiency of solution and lists any specific techniques used. 

If the problem was particular gnarly, I include a description of how the solution works. 

Solutions are in Javascript, as that is the language I'm most proficient in as of 06.16.24. That being said, I'm working through a DSA course on Educative.io that focuses on python, so I may begin submitting answers in Python in this repo.
